Thank you for using my contribution.

Just overwrite (make back-ups if necessary) your old images with these in /catalog/images ...


- table_background_specials.gif: our idea was to create some 'service vehicle' with the company name on it...
It's easy, just grab a designer program and use a black paint-tool to clear out the company name and paste your own onto it.
If anyone has a better alternative for this picture, contact me using my information below.

- table_background_default.gif: This picture should be your company logo, meaning you'll have to make your own for this one.
A good alternative is to leave this one blank. Again, if anyone has a better alternative, contact me!

- table_background_payment.gif: Euro's... Again, if anyone has a better alternative, contact me! Maybe the cashregister..?
